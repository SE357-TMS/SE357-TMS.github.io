# Activity Rules

- Write diagram in activity PlantUML syntax
- There are 3 "swimlanes", which the first is what I will tell you later (and alias the name yourself), second is Database (Short for D), third is System (short for S).
- With the generic use case (filename is same as it's parent folder name), you should follow `docs/docs/activity/view-product/view-product.md`,... You must exclude the generic in the if sections, and short in alphabet order.
- With the search use case (filename is like for search use case), you should follow `docs/docs/activity/view-product/search-product.md`,...
- With other CRUD use case, you should follow `docs/docs/activity/view-product/view-product-detail.md`, `docs/docs/activity/view-product/add-comment-to-review.md`,...
