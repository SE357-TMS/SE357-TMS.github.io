# Activity Rules

- Write diagram in activity PlantUML syntax
- There are only two swimlanes: the first is the system swimlane |S|, and the second is the actor’s swimlane (which can be customer, admin, or staff).
- The system swimlane |S| only represents the actions: display _, verify _, update _, notify _.
  The actions of the actor are usually select, enter information, submit information, click button "..." to confirm, or check the intention to continue, or represent real-world operations that are not computer behaviors, meaning input-type functions.
  Always make sure that each action is placed in the correct swimlane to which it belongs.
- Every node in the diagram must be connected to another node and be connected from another node, except for the start node and the end node.
- The names of action nodes should follow the structure: verb + noun / noun phrase. Condition nodes should also use verbs with meanings such as check, verify, etc.
- Only use if - else (not if - else if) and repeat - repeat while statements. The branch labels should also be written with an uppercase first letter, such as Yes, No, or Valid, Invalid.
- The start node and end node must always be in the actor’s swimlane.
- The first action can be select function \_\_\_ (similar or identical to the use case name, for example, select function ABC...).
- The final action can be confirm notification.
  For example, if the system displays a success message, the customer confirms the success, or simply confirms the end (instead of confirming the end of the use case), and then the end node follows.
- There must be only one start node and one end node; therefore, if any exceptions occur, they should be represented as a repeat - repeat while loop.
- The folder which only has 1 file in that folder, same filename as the folder is a special activity. It isn't generic use case, but a single use case.
